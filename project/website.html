                The photos and captions in this display were submitted by VA clinicians from throughout VHA as a part of a Photovoice project to tell the story of clinician experiences using Patient Priorities Care.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-paragraph">
                Patient Priorities Care is the preferred age-friendly, Whole Health approach to aligning health care with What Matters for older persons with multiple chronic conditions.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-paragraph">
                Here in this display, we present the experiences of sixteen VA clinicians, from nursing, medicine, psychology and social work, who have adopted the Patient Priorities Care approach as the guiding compass for the care they provide to Veterans.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-paragraph">
                The photographs and captions in this Photovoice represent the unedited thoughts and feelings of these VA clinicians who practice Patient Priorities Care in multiple care settings with older Veterans.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-paragraph">
                We hope this display encourages you to consider how to ask and act on What Matters for the Veterans you serve and learn more about the Patient Priorities Care approach.

Working with older adults to elicit and act on what matters most to them using the Patient Priories Care framework, it has become clear that What Matters is often something that seems relatively small. It could be going to a baseball game, sitting outside in the sunshine, or simply enjoying an outstanding cup of coffee. Allowing the space to focus on what matters to the older adult, instead of working through a checklist of medical issues, ensures that the little things which bring joy are not lost in a medicalized approach." - A.G.C.

Much like each drop of water coming together to create a wave in the ocean, when a care team is all on the same page in terms of the goals for a patient, we can more smoothly help a patient to re-engage in the important aspects of life." - M.S.
